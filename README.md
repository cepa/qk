# Qrczoks Killer

*You must kill Qrczoks*
Qrczoks are these bloody chickens falling from the sky with parachutes who want to annihilate you.
Your mission is to kill them all using your super secret weapon - Super Mega Anty Qrczok Cannon.
Your country needs you!

## WTF?
Found this game in my backups from years ago. I created it around 2003 in C++ using [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/) library.

It's kinda a simple stupid shooter game, but apparently still works, tried on Windows 10.

## How to run it?
* You need to download this [repository](https://github.com/cepa/qk/archive/master.zip)
* Unzip
* Run qk.exe

## How to build it?
Haven't done that for ages, so you need to figure out yourself. You'll need [Mingw](http://www.mingw.org/) compiler for Windows and [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/) installed in your system. Have a look to [src/makefile.mingw](https://github.com/cepa/qk/blob/master/src/makefile.mingw).
